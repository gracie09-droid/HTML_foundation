		<h3>What is Web Framework?</h3>
		<p>A <strong>web framework</strong> is a software toolset and <em>set of pre-written code</em> that simplifies and accelerates web application development by providing common patterns, reusable components, and tools for building interactive and reliable websites and APIs. Frameworks standardize development, improve code consistency, and offer features like built-in security and scalability, allowing developers to focus on unique application features instead of reinventing foundational code. </p>

		<h3>Key Benefits of Using a Web Framework</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Faster Development: </h4>
					<p>Frameworks offer pre-built components and tools that handle common tasks, speeding up the development process. </p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Code Reusability: </h4>
					<p>They provide common patterns and libraries, reducing the need to write repetitive code from scratch. </p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Consistency and Maintainability: </h4>
					<p>Frameworks enforce standard structures, making code easier to maintain, understand, and scale over time. </p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Security: </h4>
					<p>Many frameworks include built-in security features to help protect applications from common vulnerabilities. </p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Scalability:  </h4>
					<p>They are designed to support applications that need to grow in complexity and user load. </p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Community Support: </h4>
					<p>Popular frameworks have large developer communities offering support, resources, and solutions to problems.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>
		<p>Frameworks can be broadly categorized based on the part of the application they primarily support: </p>
		<p><strong>Front-end Frameworks:</strong> Focus on building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Examples: Angular, React, Vue.js</p></li>
			</ul>
		<p><strong>ack-end Frameworks:</strong> Handle server-side logic, databases, and API development. 
			<ul>
				<li><p>Examples: Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP), <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet" target="_blank"> ASP.NET</a> (C#)</p></li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3>When to Use a Web Framework</h3>
		<p>Frameworks are excellent for complex, professional, and scalable web applications, such as social media platforms or large e-commerce sites. They provide the necessary structure and tools for building robust, interactive, and maintainable systems. </p>

		<h3>When You Might Not Need One</h3>
		<p>For simple, personal, or local business websites, a full web framework might be unnecessary. In these cases, a smaller library for a specific task might be a more suitable and less burdensome option.</p>
		<p>This video explains what web frameworks are and why you might not need one for small projects:</p>
