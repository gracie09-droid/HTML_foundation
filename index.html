			<h2>HTML - The Foundation of the Web</h2>
				<p> Posted by <strong>Gracezelmar Sabugo</strong>

				<p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/	presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
				<br><br>
				"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between 	websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

			<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
				<p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The <em>enclosing</em> tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
				<br><br>
				HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

				<p>The Main Parts of Elements are as Follows</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The Opening Tag.</li>
						<li>The Closing Tag.</li>
						<li>The Content.</li>
						<li>The Element.</li>
					</ol>
